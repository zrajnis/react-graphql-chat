# React GraphQL Chat
Small App with sole point to touch onto connecting React with GraphQL.

### To set up the project:  
 - Install dependencies with `npm install` in both `/client` and `/server`
 - Run both in development mode with `npm run dev`  

### Production  
This project was made purely for research purposes, and of course fun, it's not really meant to be used for anything serious.  
If you're brave/insane enough to actually run this in production mode, client enables building and running prod build, but server will need some work.
